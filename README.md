## Data Structures And Algorithms
- A **Data Structure** is an arrangement of data. It is a special way of organizing, managing, storing, processing, and retrieving data.
- An **Algorithm** is used to manipulate data in these structures
  - Examples: searching through data and sorting data

| Data Structure | Advantage | Disadvantage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Array | Quick insertion, very fast access if index is known | Slow search, slow deletion, fixed size |
| Ordered Array | Quicker search than unsorted array | Slow insertion and deletion, fixed size |
| Stack | Provides last-int, first-out access | Slow access to other items |
| Queue | Provides first-in, first-out access | Slow access to other items |
| Linked List | Quick insertion, quick deletion | Slow Search |
| Binary Tree | Quick search, insertion, deletion (if tree remains balanced) | Deletion algorithm is complex |
| Red-black Tree | Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced | Complex |
| 2-3-4 Tree | Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced. Similar trees good for disk storage | Complex |
| Hash Table | Very fast access if key known. Fast insertion | Slow deletion, access if key not known, inefficient memory usage |
| Heap | Fast insertion, deletion, access to largest item | Slower access to other items |
| Graph | Models real-world situations | Some algorithms are slow and complex |
