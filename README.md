# Algorithms

- Algorithms are used to solve computational problems with finite steps
  - Algorithms can give us an idea of what the runtime will be
  - Algorithms can help us decide upon hardware requirements

# Data Structures

- Data structures are ways of storing data
  - Can help us save data efficiently
